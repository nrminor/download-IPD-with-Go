# Go program to handle HTTP Requests to the Immuno-Polymorphism Database (IPD)
MHC researchers regularly need to compile databases of allele reference sequences, which involves sending a large number of HTTP requests to European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) servers. The program here, written in Go, takes advantage of [goroutines](https://gobyexample.com/goroutines) to download allele sequence files concurrently, which speeds up total download time considerably. The program spawns 100 worker threads at a time, and can ignore any records that come before a certain release date. This allows researchers not only to download IPD alleles efficiently, but also to download only new or updated alleles since the last IPD release.
